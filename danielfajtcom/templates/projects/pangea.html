            Pangea is a name of my project created for an internet service provider company - Vodafone. Its main
            purpose, among others, was to create a network inventory system as errorless as possible (meaning “clean”
            data with no errors). It meant to build a tool capable to provide IP network discovery for more than 800.000
            host IP addresses in a meaningful time in a multi-vendor (router/switches manufacturers or mediagateways)
            environment. In less then five hours (thanks to asynchronous multiprocessing) it targeted, identified, and
            gathered device’s meta data from whole network. It could have captured unsupported devices as well and save
            only partial dataset for further processing. Biggest issue was data evaluation and parsing. Network
            discovery was a key feature, which was crucial for further automation development.
